# Exercise 2

### One of the big strengths of R is the easy and nice plotting functions. Here you can try some of them:



1. Make a histogram of mpg(miles per gallon) in mtcars, use hist() (hint: use the ‘$’ sign to access mpg)
2. Make a histogram of mpg in mtcars with more breaks. (hint: see the available options for the hist() function with f1 or ?hist(). Hint2: ‘breaks =’).
3. Make a boxplot of mpg in mtcars, use boxplot(). (To make a boxplot for each number of cylinders use: boxplot(mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$cyl))
4. Make a scatterplot of mpg in mtcars using plot()
5. Plot horsepower (hp) versus mpg using plot (hint: plot(x, y))
