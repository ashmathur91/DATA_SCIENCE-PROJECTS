# Exercise 1

### 1.1. Getting started

```
1. Calculate 10 times 3
2. Make a variable x equal to 5
3. Calculate 10 times x
````
### 1.2. Matrix operations
```
Make the matrix A equal to

1 2 4 4
3 5 3 4

1. Give A columns name by using the function colnames()
2. Add 3 to each element in the matrix and call this matrix B
3. Add A and B. What do you get?
4. Include a 5th column equal to [1,2] to your matrix A and call the new matrix D. Use the command cbind()
5. Get the third column of D.
```
### 1.3. Dataframe
```
1. There are built-in data frames examples in R. One of them are called mtcars
2. What does mtcars look like? If you write head(mtcars) you will only see the first 6 rows.
3. How big is the data frame? Use the function dim() or the functions nrow() and ncol().
4. What is the cell value from the first row, second column of mtcars?
5. Could you get the same value by using row and column names instead? Which names?
```
